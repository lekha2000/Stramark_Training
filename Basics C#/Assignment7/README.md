## Implement the body for the following function:

    static boolean isPrimeNumber(int num) {
      // do stuff here
      return false;
    }
    
The function should check and return true only if the number passed as argument is a prime number.

Write a C# program to call the above function multiple times with different values.

## For Example 
    User Input Number : 3
    Then
    Display should be 3 is prime 
    
    Here in checkprime what it does is it takes user input as parameter
    then checks the condition if condition matching then returns true else false
