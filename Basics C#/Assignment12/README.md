## Customer Database Application CRUD

    Create a Console App that stores the Customer Records into an Array.

    The App should allow the User to Add, Remove, Update and Find the Customers by ID.

    The App should be a menu-driven App that allows the user to choose an option and perform the expected operation. 
    The App should not terminate at any point unless chosen by the User.
    Make the App Interactive with User inputs coming from Console.
    Hint: Create separate classes for Customer, CustomerRepo which have functions of Operations, 
    and UI Class that will handle the UI of the Application. Make the       
    App as modular as possible.
